# Card Sharks Challenge Higher or Lower
The purpose of this project is to learn how to interact with iOS mobile application and build input/output for the screen.  This will be a game similar to Card Sharks where the user will guess higher or lower for the next card and will receive points or be deducted points if they are right or wrong.

### Rules of the Game heading

At the beginning of the game, the player will be presented with a card.
The player will then guess if the next card is Higher or Lower than the current card shown.
Rankings of the cards will be from Ace (1) to King (13)
If the player guesses correctly they will double their points if they guess incorrectly their points go to zero and they will start back at the first card again.  If their points are already zero and they guess correctly they will receive one point.
The game will continue until they have guessed at least 5 cards.
NOTE: That will be 6 cards in total including the first card shown.
The player will win the game if they guess all the cards correctly
If the player wins the game take them to a new screen that says “You Won” and give them a button to “Play Again”


<br>NOTE: There is a cards.zip file in the zipped file I uploaded that you can use for the cards/backgrounds.
