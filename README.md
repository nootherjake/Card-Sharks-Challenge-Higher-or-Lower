# Card-Sharks-Challenge-Higher-or-Lower
The purpose of this project is to learn how to interact with iOS mobile application and build input/output for the screen.  This will be a game similar to Card Sharks where the user will guess higher or lower for the next card and will receive points or be deducted points if they are right or wrong.
